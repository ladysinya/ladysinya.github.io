            <p>So Jimmy thought it'd be funny to play a prank on the team. He changed the exit code for the aquarium, and he thought it'd be fun to hide a riddle for us to find the answer. He even went so far as to make a decoder disk and hide the riddle in one of the puzzles we give the animals to play with. What is this, a spy aquarium now? Unfortunately, he didn't tell us right away and now the puzzle with the clue in it is missing. On top of that someone thought part of the decoder disk was a toy too and now it's missing too. Maybe if we can find all those pieces we can unlock the door to the aquarium sometime this century. They must be in some of the exhibits. He'd better be bringing donuts tomorrow to make up for this.</p>

            <p>For a bit of fun today, we took the penguins out for a tour of the aquarium. It was funny watching them interact with the other animals. They didn't interact with all of them, but they really seemed to enjoy the Alligators, the Lizards, the Sea Turtles, and the Butterfly Garden.</p>

            <p>Those silly penguins are some of the pickiest animals in the aquarium. I went to feed them this morning and they refused to eat. They even tried to snap their little beaks at me when I tried to pull out a fish. Finally, Jimmy told me that they never eat until all of their friends have been fed. First, I had to feed the Jellyfish, then the Otters, then the Alligator and finally the Octopi. Then they finally let me feed them without trying to bite off my fingers. Well at least I know the little fellas are loyal to their friends. Cute, but still annoying.</p>

            <p>Those little otters are so adorable. And playful too. Sometimes I'll take my lunch by their exhibit so that I can watch them play. Last week I got a new Joke Book and read a few to them. They seemed to find them quite funny, if their chittering was any indication.</p>

            <p>The baby sea turtles hatched today. I tried to go into the exhibit to make sure they made it to their shoreline, but the pass to get in was locked in the safety box. I know it was out when I left yesterday, so whoever ran the last show yesterday must have been the one to lock it up. I'll have to ask around to see who it was so I can get them to unlock the safety box.</p>

            <p>The lizards are sneaky little critters. They are forever escaping the reptile house and wandering off to other parts of the aquarium. I've had to round them up at least 3 times this week already. They are cute though. They love it when I FLIP THEM OVER for belly rubs.</p>
