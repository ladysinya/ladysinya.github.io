            <p>Those silly penguins are some of the pickiest animals in the aquarium. I went to feed them this morning and they refused to eat. They even tried to snap their little beaks at me when I tried to pull out a fish. Finally, Jimmy told me that they never eat until all of their friends have been fed. First, I had to feed the Jellyfish and the Otters and then the Alligator and the Octopi. Then they finally let me feed them without trying to bite off my fingers. Well at least I know the little fellas are loyal to their friends. Cute, but still annoying.</p>

            <p>The baby sea turtles hatched today. I tried to go into the exhibit to make sure they made it to their shoreline, but the pass to get in was locked in the safety box. I know it was out when I left yesterday, so whoever ran the last show yesterday must have been the one to lock it up. I'll have to ask around to see who it was so I can get them to unlock the safety box.</p>
